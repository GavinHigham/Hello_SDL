/*
A trackball should take user input (mouse movement, mouse presses) and translate it into drag actions on a ball or turntable.
This should produce some useful forms of output:
	Rotation matrix for objects being rotated
	Orbiting camera
		position
		target
		lookat matrix

It should be able to limit rotation on various axes, and have configurable easing
(perhaps even "soft edges" if the user tries to drag outside the allowed rotation range).

To create a trackball control like what one finds in a 3D modelling program, I'd also need to be aware of the camera's position relative
to the trackball. I may handle that later, but for now it's outside the scope of the implementation.
